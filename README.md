The new features we added in:

drag right to change the task's color.
tap on the hamburger icon to add sub tasks.
edit and delete the sub tasks.
some bug fixed.

#EasyNote-Final

updates:

*Add a calendar page.

*User can create their notes base on the calendar.

*Remove the sub-task function form the previous version (after talk with several users, we thought they don't really need this function)

*Persistent User Data using IndexedDB, this is a REAL APP that user can put into bookmark and use it.

Enjoy.
